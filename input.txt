Im exactly 2 weeks into this pill and Ive never reacted so negatively to a medication before Almost every day being on Junel Ive felt extremely nauseated tired bloated gained five pounds I wouldnt have put this since that could be contributed to fluctuating weight but Ive had a decreased appettite and the weighgain keeps adding up If youre not taking well to the meds from the getgo I highly recommend not to drink while on Junel I vommitted horribly after only 2 weak drinks at home the other night which was very unusual for me The whole reason I started taking this medication was for less painful menstrual cramps The past 4 days Ive had cramping and breakthrough bleeding No thanks Ill go back to feeling normal and having the bad cramps 12 days a month after all these side effects I cant rate this product on effectiveness with prevention of pregnancy because Ive had no desire since the start of this medication Definitely think about it before trying Junel
I have been on Junel for about a year now Pros I no longer have cramps and i have a lighter and shorter period I dont get headaches anymore I havent gained or lost weight either Cons ive had a lot of break through bleeding missed period for 2 months in a row moodiness and upset all the time It works great but my boyfriend is getting tired of my mood swings
I started Junel the first day of my period and the next day i had a lot of thick clots The good thing was my period only lasted about four days with my norm being 78 days The side effects i experienced right away were headache bad fatigue and nausea which went away after a few days but what really scared me was the pain in my left arm and chest and shortness of breath that started about 20 minutes after i would take each pill and it lasted for hours I also experienced acid reflux and would wake up every morning cold and drenched in sweat Also my mood went from excellent on Lexapro to very emotional and moody I have only been on this medication for two weeks and cannot tolerate it I have had trouble finding a birth control pill that will not interfere with my anxietydepression or make it worse and have not been very successful These reviews have really been helpful in my last two attempts to get back on the pill and its good to know im not the only one dealing with these outrageous side effects I hope my review helps anyone who is thinking about this drug or is on it and is experiencing the same thing I stopped taking it today and have been pain free all day so far
I am almost done with my 1 month packet and I am switching BCs I cannot take it anymore I am dizzy sore nauseous overlysensitive unfocused  tired all the time It has made me very emotional and bipolar One minute I am crying excessively over stupid things and the next thing you know I hate everyone Yesterday I was looking for a laptop online and this customer service lady popped up and I got so angry at her for showing up Also I have started swearing constantly but I cant stop it Do not take thisunless you want to be pissed off at the world and cry at the same time
I am currently on my first pack of Junel I have never been on birth control before but I cannot continue to miss work due to getting extremely sick because of my periods Since the age of twelve they have made me pass out throw up and have extremely bad cramps to the point of just laying there crying So I started on Junel so far I always feel so depressed and cry about everything which is not me at allI will be perfectly happy one minute and upset the next I am not even done with my first pack and I have already started my period and getting cramps which are not as bad as normal I am getting acne on my face which I have NEVER had before I dont know if I should continue to take Junel or try something different I feel as though being depressed is controlling my life and ruining my relationships with people Any suggestions on what to do
Especially after reading the reviews I wish I had switched off this BC sooner Ive been taking it for a year now and have an appt tomorrow because I realized my mood swings have gotten out of hand I get upset so easily My goal and challenge will now be to find a form of BC that works without making me so moody Any suggestions
I started taking it on the first day of my period Had no side affects until the 2nd day Started getting nausous and throwing up My period is heavier than usual the cramps which usually go away after the second day lasted my entire period and were much worse than usual It also made me moody have night sweats irregular heart beat and throw up Not something I would recommend
When I am on the placebo pills I do not get my period When I am on the real pills I do get my period I spot most of the monthI am going to get off this I ahve been on it for 6 months just to be sure to give it a good chance but this spotting is a real problem I have been wearing a pad for the past 6 months of my life
I take the pill to relieve my severe period symptoms It also seemed like a good decision since Im sexually active I havent had any mood problems outside of my regular clinical depression or any weight gain like some on this site but one thing that was horrible was the breakouts it caused Ive always had clear smooth skin and this stuff had me looking like a pepperoni pizza not even 3 weeks into taking it I stayed on it since I figured I could change my regimen and fix it but its only gotten worse and it killed my self esteem Im starting Ortho Cyclen tonight so hopefully that will be good for me
I have been on probably every form of birth control imaginable so I think my assessment of these drugs might be accurate to those with my condition The first form of BC I was on was Loestrine to which I lost a ton of weight but wanted to murder everyone that even looked at me Yaz did the same My weight remained consistent but the same time every month I thought my life was coming to an end and there was no point of me even living any more Through several other attempts to regulate both my period and my mood my doctor decided Junel Fe would be the best fit for me Boy was she wrong Im still just as depressed Im fatigued all the time not to mention since being on it for 4 months now I have gained about 20 lbs I work out every day and eat healthier than most Im starting Zovia next month and lets keep our fingers crossed that this will help me get rid of my Junel Fat
I had a horrible experience on this birth control It was the first I had tried and I found that it made me VERY nauseous even when I took it with a meal as I was instructed to do by my doctor I took it with dinner every night around 7pm and without fail I would wake up at 430am every night feeling horribly nauseous I actually lost quite a bit of weight that I didnt need or want to lose mostly because of my nausea and loss of appetite Being constantly nauseous also messed up my sex life as I never felt well enough to have sex which my partner and I were less than happy with I stopped taking this after the first pill of my 3rd cycle when the nausea heightened to the point that I actually vomited Since stopping the pill I have still been experiencing nausea which I can only assume is related to the pill I absolutely would NOT recommend this pill to anybody
Reading over the reviews of this drug Im relieved that Im not the only one who has been experiencing the side affects from taking it My Doctor switched me last month from Loestrin to Junel During the second week I started to not feel like myself I felt like I wasnt really here I questioned my relationship I was just really lost Ive been off of it for about a week now and Im feeling more in control of my emotions thoughts and life
The first month I was completely fine I took it exactly as instructed and began to be sexually active two weeks into it I had only mild side effects such as bloating breast swellingtenderness and spotting The second month this month however I have headaches fatigue liquid out of one of my breasts frequent urination and most of all incapacitating nausea I take it at night right after dinnerI usually wake up around seven feeling like Im going to vomit on my bed Bleh And then it goes on and off through the day Either this pill has failedOr Im just so small that it is kind of an overdose Either way I cant continue this pill Looks like Im back to the rubbers
I never thought to research other peoples experiences on this bc because ive always dealt with depression but lately ive also been having horrible anxiety panic attacks and irritability I dont know if its all connected Im currently not even sexually active i just liked it because it kept me regular but i can tell my sex drive is down have feelings like irregular heartbeats again i dont know if its connected but i dont currently take anything else periods were ideal very short  light but im beginning to think that all the mood effects arent worth it plus i think i gained 5lbs ive been working out the past month exercise and diet and havent seen much of an improvement think its time to say goodbye to you junel also my skin SUCKS on it right now i have a huge like un poppable pimple under my cheek its been there for 2 weeks now lame sauce
I started taking Birth control for exactly that reason While I was on Junel FE I turned into a completely different person I was moody aggressive and depressed I also gained at least 40 pounds on it as soon as i stopped taking it I turned back into my self again I would not recommend this Birth Control to any one
ive been on this for several months now and have had no problems with it thus far The only thing that tends to happen is that i will randomly lightly bleed when i am not taking the iron pills I dont have bad mood swings my hair does not fall out i have not gained or loss any weight nothing

Ive had my period for 2 weeks while on it I was only on them for 2 weeks Also I feel angry and negative about everything like I have PMS or depression I quit taking them I hope my mood goes back to normal
Junel Fe has been pretty good for me Its effective and the iron pills prevent me from being sluggish the week of inactive pills I dont think I have had any emotional side effects or any other problems with it
i used this because it was suppose to give me 3 days of period Id get three days and then like very low beleeding for two more days I got PMS almost throughout my cycle and thered be months where id have no sex drive whatsoever Im switching now because my mood swings and sex drive on them are horrible
I have been on Junel Fe for almost 3 years I forget to take it on time sometimes which is my own doing but other than that I am very happy with it My periods are lighter my cramps are not as bad and no babies  I havent had many side effects I recommend Junel Fe
The first two months I experienced sore nipples however during those two months my breasts grew a little over a cup size Let it be noted though that I also gained five pounds and had an increased appetite It hasnt affected my sex drive though Ive had a little bit more acne for a bit Junel was the fourth birth control Ive tried and I had horrifying mood swings or physical conditions due to the first three With Junel Id occasionally feel a little down and there were a good two months when I felt very emotionally numb However this is the only one Ive tried so far that didnt basically physically or emotionally cripple me so Im somewhat satisfied
On Junel I have the shortest and lightest periods of my life I used to have extremely heavy periods like couldnt even sit through an hour long class without both a pad and heavy tampon or Id have a leak I have used Yaz in the past and Junel is even more effective With Junel my periods only last 34 days and only one day really requires anything more than a liner to manage the flow
Ive been on Junel fe for 5 months now and its good so far Switching to this birth control was super easy I didnt break out although it doesnt seem to be helping my mild acne and for the last 2 months during the 3rd week of pills Ive developed a rash on my cheek that goes away in a few days dont know if there related Also i have not had spotting or breakthrough bleeding at all on this pill and my period is 3 days and light Have experienced some weight gain mainly in my boobs and some days have extreme bloating but nothing dramatic Overall great pill However Im switching to the non generic brand to see if that helps with acne
I was given Junel because my original BC Gildes was recalled I gained 15 lbs have headaches cramps and I keep thinking that I am pregnant I only took the pill for 15 weeks but I felt horrible All I ever wanted to do was crawl into bed and never leave
Ive been on birth control pills for 7 years now and I am 21 I started taking junel about a year and a half ago and stopped getting my period after 3 months Havent had a period in over a year which my gyno said was normal but I think I will switch pills anyway just to be safe I have lost considerable amount of weight not sure if that is related to the pill or not
I have been on this med for about 4 months I mainly got on Junel due to the fact that I wanted to gain weight which it indeed help me with However the breakthrough bleeding inbetween periods sucks And then when is my period coming who knowsit kind of freaks a 21 yo female out Pregnancy is not a thing any person wants to guess on A period tells us women that our uterine lining in sloughing off and that their is no implanted fetus in there
Starting taking Loestrin Fe for excessive PMS issues The Loestrin Fe became more and more expensive so I asked the dr to change to an inexpensive generic  Junel Fe First months was okay second month ended with yeast infection third month I am constantly feeling sick light headed painful stomach cramps bloating constipation and urgent feeling to go to the bathroom but then nothing happens these symptoms are really too much After reading the other reviews I am stopping this pill today as it seems like there is not a end to my symptoms and even more are yet to come acne hair loss depression
I started taking Junel a month ago and now have started the first week of my second pack The first month was okay minor nausea sore breasts minor bloating did not notice mood changes not sure about my sex drive I did not get my period during my placebo week Now that I have started the second month I feel terrible The most noticeable symptom is AWFUL BLOATING 5 hours after I eat lunch I feel completely full with no appetite I am a runner so I run intensely almost every day and my runs have just SUCKED i always feel tired heavy and just not in it Not sure why but this second pack has made me feel dull unmotivated and my bloating makes me just want to sit and do nothing I want to switch but its so complicated to do all that however I think I am going to stop taking them tonight because I just hate this bloating its not worth it
Ive been on this birth control for almost a year now Before i even was on the pill my periods were very light and not crampy or painful I started taking this pill and my period basically dissapeared It was not a good thing ladies i either would get it a week late or go without a period for 3 months I took pregnancy tests and everything because i was so concerned After looking at the reviews i realized that this is a common side effect people on this Birth Control have Hope this helps anyone going through what im going through
I just finished my first pack today and i already have a yeast infection I didnt get my period 21 day and i always am nauseous Ive been really moody and i cry all the time im hopefully getting my new birth control today
I have been on Junel Fe for over a year now and love it My cycles are short and hardly and cramping I believe everyone is going to be different but I have felt wonderful the entire time
This was my first BC ever and I gotta tell you I am never getting on any BC EVER again Doc told me to take it on my first day of period and I have been bleeding for two weeks and counting Not to mention I am having the worst cramps ever and Im not even on my period anymore I think My bf doesnt like how it makes me sick and told me to get off it I stopped taking it four days ago but the pain and bleeding is still there UGH FORGET THAT Long Live TROJAN No more pills for me This pill needs to be taken off the market like ASAP
You guys have NO idea how relieved I am to read most of these reviews I was put On Junel about 6 months ago after having been on Mircette for almost 2 years I was switched due to some mood problems around what would normally be ovulation time but trust me I would FAR prefer that then the side effects of Junel Starting about 23 months ago I started getting what I thought was just PMStype symptoms but it very quickly turned into severe depression I had absolutely no sex drive whatsoever I didnt even want to think about it I felt completely hopeless sad and just out of it and not myself I would be in the middle of my workday or watching TV or any other random activity and I would suddenly find myself thinking about the most ridiculous things like Why should I bother to do this and that or whatever for the future Im just gonna get old and die Sounds stupid but it was horrific And it was constant I was crying nearly every day for no reason at all I didnt even need something to set it off I would just cry many times as soon as I got into bed and bawl my eyes out until I finally fell asleep I was barely getting any rest because of this so I was sleeping half my days away It was really truly awful I just stopped taking them a week ago today and the mood has improved immensely Not at 100 just yet but I hope to be there soon Definitely going to the doctor to see if theres anything else I can try ASAP I cant really comment on how effective it was against pregnancy because you couldnt have paid me enough money to have sex while on it Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who posted on here I feel so much more hopeful now knowing that chances are Im not going insane and that it was just that stupid pill
I have only been on this pill for one week and its been a nightmare From day one I felt irritable sensitive fatigue anger isolated very moody and no sexual desire I also started getting severe acne on my face I am stopping this pill tommorow not a day more with this pill Dont waste your time this BC is totally not worth it
When I first started taking this medication it made me a bit more emotional than usual and I found myself having some mood swings I also had continual spotting for almost all of the first month on it However after letting my body adjust I feel perfectly fine It is easy to take everyday and the periods are light and only last 34 days In the past I used to have extremely bad cramps so this has been a very good lifestyle change
I have been on this med for 4 weeks now and being the first time i have ever used birth control for both the uses of Birth control and Acne reasons The only side affect i have really noticed is the mood swings like everyone else I am also very happy with its effectivness because I and my boyfriend have had a couple condom breakages since ive been on the pill both being accidental The pill is easy to take and remeber at 730am It has been very easy on my system and i have not had any feelings of being sick I am very happy with this med so far well see how it goes in the months a head
I find this birth control to be very effective when it comes to shortening my periods and ive experienced a huge decrease in how long and heavy my periods are Only negatives are that ive randomly spotted every month ive been taking this except one also my breasts get very sore sometimes and some of these scare me that im possibly pregnant but theyre just normal side effects of the medication ive never had trouble remembering to take my pill every day at 10 pm just always have to remember to take it with me if i know ill be out over all i say this is a very good birth control and would suggest it to anyone thats just beginning C
I am 28 years old I have been taking this pill for one month I have been on different kinds of pills but this is the worst The only positive thing is it has made my period back to normal again after having fibroids and having my period 25 days out of the month I would rather have the bleeding I now have acne on my entire back chest and even on my neck I am extremely irritable all the time My hair seems thinner and there seems to be more coming out when I brushwash it I have been having trouble sleeping I have been scatterbrained and have been having trouble finding the word I want to say in conversation so I sound like an idiot I am usually fairly articulate I am actually going to stop this pill immediately and try to schedule surgery to remove the fibroid Yes I would prefer surgery to this horrible pills side effects
I stopped taking birth control for three years because Ive had issues with them making me crazy I was assured this is a really low dose and should be fine I have since experienced depression extreme anxiety paranoia lack of sex drive and major mood swings I would NOT recommend this to anyone
I had to switch to this generic due to insurance I am not happy with it I had bad mood swings and severe constipation Now that I am off the pill I have gone back to normal I would not recommend this at all
I just took this pill forteh first time at 830 last night this morning at 830 i began to get really overheated and a little dizzy i thought i might throw up but i didnt about 30 seconds later im walking out of the bathroom into the hall of my dorm and i got tunnel vision everything was going black till i couldnt see anymore i was running into walls trying to get to my room i made it to my bed and layed down This probably took place over the course of just a few minutes but it was terrifying I called my doctor and she told me to stop taking Junel
I started taking this med because it was a cheap alternative I have been on it 8 month and the last three have not had a period Im tired all the time I sleep way too much Im easily irratable And have tons of problems with my contacts and infections in my eyes since I started this pill Im not so sure I would reccommend it to anyone Not getting a period is nice but scary And mood and sight are also important
I started taking this drug about 2 weeks ago and boy not only did my hair start falling out but my sex drive plumeted as well I have had the MOST horriable mood swings I will just sit and cry for no reason at all I have stopped taking this drug I would not recommend it for anyone
I have been on Junel for a year now and my sex drive has gone down hill ever since I have also had issues with it making my hair fall out It was great for decreasing my periods but I wont be taking it anymore
Gave me terrible acne nausea every day frequent headaches and has caused me to be extremely irritable and overemotional I have had very bad cramps too I want to get off of this medication as soon as I possibly can
I was put on Junel for ovarian cysts and pain during my period and since starting Junel I havent had any problems with my ovaries and the pain has gone down a lot Ive been on Junel for over a year and havent had any problems with it I havent had any painful cysts reoccur or irregularity with periods I havent had any problems with weight gain or acne either
ive been on Junel Fe for about 2 weeks now and my mood has just been horrible ive also had my period for 3 weeks and im getting major depression signs its not helping at all also ive gained a lil weight and my sex drive has been down

I was taking microgestin fe 120 but the pharmacy gave me this one in replacement for two months Since taking Junel Ive had headaches mood swings acne break outs on my chest fatigue and low libido I didnt have any of these issues on microgestin I also have been on orth tri cyclen and had no issues I called the pharmacy to make sure they give me the microgestin from now on Horrible birth control
I am 36yr and I have been on this birth control for 4yrs and I love it
Made me get recurring yeast infections I never had any vaginal problems until taking this medication I just finished my last pack I had very painful breasts and was very moody and emotional It also made me hungry 247 Worked great for preventing pregnancy but the side effects are not worth it so Im done
I started taking this after taking loestrin fe I been on it for almost 3 months and after the first month I stopped getting my period I already have one kid so its kind of scary if you just suddenly stop gettin periods Also i never had acne till I got on this pill
This medicine has caused a lot of weight gain for me My appetite has increased considerably and this is not normal for me I am a very slim person or was before I started taking Junel I plan to stop taking it for a few months and see if there is any improvement in my weight gain
The first few months I would get my period on the days when I was taking the regular pills not the placebos I attributed it to my body having lower hormone levels than it was used to When I did get my period it was definitely short but the first day would be extremely heavy Ive now been on Junel for over 18 months and have altogether stopped having a period Havent had one in 7 months I have not noticed any effect on my mood but I do cry at any sign of emotion in the media movies radio commercials etc which did not used to happen My sex drive has been nonexistent since starting this BC its difficult to lubricate and sex can be painful without additional artificial lubricant Glad to hear Im not the only one suffering these symptoms
First of all I want to acknowledge the difficulty that many of the prior reviewers have been experiencing while taking Junel  After reading their reviews some of my own experiences began to make sense to me At present I am taking Junel 21 and I like it overall Yes there is some breast tenderness around the time of my period I however have had an increase in my sexual drive and an improvement in my IBS symptoms I am diagnosed with Fibromyalgia  I have not felt lethargic but this may be a balance between the Junel and my other medications I am not sure I have not had any major acne breakouts but did have a small unexplained eczematype rash on my arm for a short period of time I am a little moodier around my period but nothing severe and unmanageable My biggest problem with Junel is the inconsistency with having my period  Sometimes I do Sometimes I dont It makes it a bit worrisome as I am sexually active  So every now and then I find myself doing pregnancy tests  Overall for me Junel has been okay I was on Loestrin 24 before which I prefer but because of an insurance switch had to change to Junel 21 All in all not bad but may need to be balanced with other medications in order to be most effective and perhaps more counseling is needed on the sideeffects of this bc by our providers Hope this review helps
I started taking this medication in February because it was less exoensive then the one I was currently taking A few months later I missed my period but there didnt seem to be any other side effects Although after about 6 months of taking it I began experiencing horrible mood swings where I would just start crying without warrant I also developed heart palpitations acne and the worst part hot flashes Ive been on a different bcp for about a week now and almost all of my symptoms have disappeared
I originally was on Ortho Tri before my doctor randomly switched me to this saying it was basically the same They are NOT Ive been on Junel for almost 67 months now and after reading all these reviews Im realizing a lot of my symptoms and problems are from this pill First off I have NO sex drive At all I do not desire it And even during sex when I try for my bf Im always dry andor my body does not respond to his touches Secondly I have put on 40 lbs and Ive always been a slim girl And even with high intense cardio kickboxing classes I still havent gotten the weight off Also my periods are more painful and involve extreme bloating and sever constipation Ive never had that before on my old BC Also occasionally while in the middle of the week with the white pills Ill feel like Im randomly having cramps and it hurts I would not suggest this pill to anyone
I cannot believe my doctor would even prescribe this birth control its known for being horrible I became very sad once i was on this pill and im a very happy person too I had my period for two weeks while taking the pill not even the sugar pills also while menstruating i found pieces of uterus tissues coming out along with the blood This freaked me out and i stopped taking this pill i wouldnt recommend this to anybody there is a good chance it will mess up your body
I have taken this pill for a week now and am in love it with I use to have the worst mood swings on my old bc or even when I wasnt taking any BC Being a firefighter the guys at the station knew when it was that time of month and would hate working with me cause I was a complete and total btch I didnt want to do anything and when I did I would be in a really bad mood I would randomly cry and Im NEVER one to cry But then next thing you knew I was the happiest person on the planet Before taking Junel I was a mess Within the week of getting on this pill I have noticed a boost in energy and am constantly in a good mood With this boost of energy I have been finding more time to go to the gym and play golf I dont know how its going to effect my sex drive like so many other reviews are saying So far I havent noticed a difference in sex drive  Overall I do give this pill a good review Its helped with my moods energy and my period has only lasted a couple days which is the best thing ever Going from lasting a full 7 days to 3 days
I had none of the bad side effects that Ive been reading on here Perhaps you need at least 3 months for the body to adjust to the new hormones I lost weight had no acne whatsoever mood was great high energy etc The only awful side effect I experienced was lack of sex drive It was so low I hardly ever had sex with my bf which explains how effective junel can be I am switching to OTC Lo this month
I do have to say that in order to properly evaluate a birth control pill you should be on it for 3 months My first month was terrible My breasts were SO tender I was moody I didnt feel well in general After being on Junel for about 5 months I am getting off of it as soon as my new health insurance kicks in in 2 months The reason being that my breasts still get VERY tender about 2 weeks out of the month but mainly because I have no sex drive whatsoever LikeNONE This is so not me and while my boyfriend hasnt complained per se I do feel like its affecting our relationship Plus I like having sex This is just not me Just a little warning and wondering if anyone else has had my issues
I have been on this drug for about 9 months and I my biggest problem is absolutely no sex drive The point in taking a birth control is because your having sex but if you have no drive then there is no point On the bright side I didnt gain weight or become moody from this
I didnt experience any mood swings or other serious side effects but I would always begin bleeding the week before the sugar pill which was a problem Overall pretty good experience
I took Junel Fe for about a year and a half I got my period every so often not during the sugar pills Which makes me think it wasnt protecting me from pregnancy However birth control effects people in different ways If you need a lose does pill than this might be the pill for you
I took Junel for just about 2 weeks and stopped It was awful I gained 7 lbs in the 2 weeks and had severe stomach bloating No pain but my stomach but the bloating was unbearable
Im normally a really happy and positive person but since I started taking Junel about a week ago Ive been so sad all the time for absolutely no reason Ill cry or freak out over the littlest things I have a history of anxiety and depression but its tolerable for me without being on medication In the past I had been on Yaz and it made me gain a lot of weight so I stopped taking it As of recent I had become more sexually active and gotten into a relationship so I figured looking into a new BC would be a good idea My doctor put me on Junel because its ridiculously cheaponly 2 with my insurance and I figured it would be a good start while I looked into IUD which is what I really want Well after only a week the paranoid feelings of being alone and crying all the time are getting to be way too much for me to handle I dont feel like myself anymore My boyfriend says Ive been off the past week always upset about everything I thought maybe it was just my period but I never get bad periods and I get slightly moody with them occasionally but nothing like the way Ive been feeling on Junel After reading everyones experiences and realizing Im not crazy or alone in the way this pill has been effecting me Im going to stop using it for the time being I wouldnt suggest this to anyone with a history of depression
Ive been on it for 6 to 7 months I am extremely irritable ad emotional and I also get 2 periods every month one the 2 nd week and one during the sugar pills It makes me so tired and week and this month is the first time my second period lasted like a day and hasnt come back I too have to take pregnancy tests just to ease my worry and all that I get bursts of energy I can usually make it at work but after I too am like a zombie Mostly I sleep Im always extremely tired I wanna switch but I worry bout whatever theyll put me on next I might just get the 5 year thing I just cant take 2 periods every month anymore 
While taking Junel I had moodswings I didnt want to be around people and randomly felt depressed My acne worsened and got a rash on my chest I lost some weight I would not recommend this birth control to anyone
I started taking birth control because I am a runner and have never had a regular period and was told that I would be more susceptible to stress fractures So I began to take Junel because it was supposed to be a low dosage one At first I didnt notice really anything besides that if I didnt take it right away in the morning then I would start spotting Everything just started going downhill from there I was always emotional and felt like I was on the verge of crying all the time which is so unlike me For the two months that I was on Junel I gained about 5 pounds which isnt a life changing amount but still a lot for when Im running 60 or so miles a week All of my races kept getting worse and worse and finally we came to the conclusion that it might be the birth control I dont feel nearly as competitive as I used to be and I overall started getting depressed I was questioning every aspect of my life and had no motivation whatsoever and all I wanted to do was sleep Im hoping that in the next few weeks without Junel I will be back to my normal self I wouldnt recommend this birth control and will definitely do more research before I try birth control again
I really liked using Junel Fe because I have really short and light periods only last 3 days The only reason Im switching is because the hormone dosage is so low that if I take the pill a few hours later than I normally do I have spotting Other than that a great birth control with almost no side effects for me
So far I havent had any nausea which I usually get from birth control and no hair loss or acne as other people have been complaining about The only problem is that if I forget to take it at the same time every day I get spotting but Ive only been on it for 2 weeks so well see how it goes And my sex drive has actually gone up
This birth control was excellent at decreasing the length and the intensity of my periods BUT it made my hair fall out and drastically changed the texture of my hair The benefits of the lighter periods and less intense cramps DOES NOT outweigh the risks of hair loss
I have been on Junel for a year now and I have nothing but good to say about it My periods are light I have NO cramps bloating headaches etc  I do not experience any side effects from the pill It is very effective as well This is the first birth control I have tried and I LOVE it
I started taking this about 5 months ago after having been on Ortho Tricyclen Lo for 4 years Just two months ago I stopped getting my periodswhich I assume is because of my body adjusting to the change in hormone levels after 3 months of being on Junel Fea little nervous and not sure why this change has happened I have not been sexually active recently so that cannot be the problem of a pregnancy I also have noticed some mood changes too I might have to switch if I dont get my periods soon it seems so unnatural for that to happen
On it for severe menstrual cramping Worked wonders for me
Gave me extreme anxiety made me gain 15 pounds in 3 months Awful dont use
I started taking Junel because I had been dealing with horrific cramps my entire life and I had been experiencing extremely heavy long periods accompanied by terrible cervical pain Birth control had been suggested but I was apprehensive to taking it After 5 months on the pill I have no idea why I was so nervous Its WONDERFUL I started taking Junel fe 120 on the first day of my cycle as instructed by my gyn and it improved things instantly My period lightened immediately and the cramps dissipated by the fourth day I experienced very minimal spotting during my first month but nothing that was an inconvenience During my second month my period only lasted four days It is now down to two which is a huge improvement from my former 9 day cycles I had no other side effects from the pill aside from a dizzy spell on my 5th day and a short fuse on my 13th The pill has made my period nearly nonexistent cleared up the bits of hormonal acne I was prone to getting right before my period started and actually improved my libido And to all the ladies out there who are worried about weight gain You will not gain any weight unless you eat more calories than you burn Period If Junel increases your appetite simply eat as much as you did prior to taking the pill or get a little more physical activity I actually lost 3 lbs after starting Junel
I have been taking Junel for about nine months and my one complaint is a major one i dont get periods before being on BC i had always had short light periods but now they either last a day and are very light or dont happen at all for months at a time ive gotten myself so worked up about worrying about being pregnant to the point where i have to take a home pregnancy test every once in a while for peace of mind this is reason enough to stay away from this pill however everyone is different aside from this one horrible effect i dont have any other complaints about Junel No weight gain mood changes fatigue or changes in skin
This has been a horrible experience I was on the Nuva Ring until I couldnt afford it anymore with no side effects at all I have been taking Junel for about 2 12 months and gained about 10 lbs skin problems and mood swings I stopped using it yesterday The worst is that Ive been working out 56 days a week and dieting and the weight will not come off Hopefully after stopping Ill see some change
This is the worse BC pill I have ever been on It has turned me into a btch And extreme ACNE and anxiety Not worth all the side effects
i am 28 just had my first baby 7 months ago was never on birth control went on lo estrin pill after delivery but after i stopped breast feeding my obgyn put me on this junel pill Ive been taking it for 3 weeks and i knoiw something has shifted  Depression detachment anxiety heart palpultations numbeness foggyness dryheaving spacyness shakey oody grumpy nooooooo sex drive diarea I had to look this crap up n now i know its this pill ive been a happy person all my life  the pill is in the trash today should be off the market why does the fda let woman take this crap why cant the dam men start takig something 1 warning 1 stop taking this pill if your goin crazyyy
WOW I am so happy I looked up this medication to see if anyone was experiencing the same thing I also have ZEROOOO desire to have sex Ive been taking Junel for about 5 months now I linked this to the bc pretty quickly because Ive been in a relationship for 3 years and I went from wanted to do it all the time to NEVER And I knew it wasnt him because now I dont even think about anything remotely sexual at allabout anyone or anything It just doesnt even enter my mind anymore Sometimes I try to initiate things because I feel like I should want to but nothing happens I dont feel turned on or anything Its so weird Its like Im dead I just go to sleep Previously I was on LoEstrin for about 5 years and LOVED it However my new insurance wouldnt cover it I was told this was comparable Wrong I cant wait to get off Junel
I ignored all of the negative reviews for this and it was a huge mistake I recently went on Junel for the first time I took Levora for 8 years and had no issues with it aside from a 35 pound weight gain but after being off of it for a few months I decided to try another one that would potentially not cause me to gain weight I should have taken the weight gain This medication made me feel like I was losing my mind I broke out terribly was extremely irritable and had EXTREME anxiety and depression Junel basically turned me into a zombie I already suffer from anxiety so maybe this isnt a good choice for people who have anxiety to begin with Go with Levora
first thing i would like to say is NO PROBLEMS i dont understand why everyone is upset by this pill maybe i got lucky i dont know but my attitudesmood swings have stayed normal no increase in anything and yes I GET MY PERIOD EVERY MONTH never heard of anyone not getting them for that long unless preggo but i always get mine its shorter and lighter but i still get it MAYBE this pill isnt right for everyone but it is great for me i was on lo estrin 24 before and had lost my insurance and could not afford the 70bucks for it so my doctor gave me junel i love it its the same as my lo estrin was maybe a little better but dont let all the reviews scare you away it depends on your body give a try you may like it you may not if you dont try something else i didnt like a lot of the other pills out there til i got lo estrin and now junel
I was put on this birth control by my doctor when I described my horrible periods After three months I was happier healthier no weight gain no mood swings and a four day healthy period Im so thankful for it I recently went to visit my obgyn Im getting married soon and it will be my first time being sexually active and she told me that if I was faithful to the pill I would continue to see positive results I believe many people are not taking the pill when they should When I miss a day or two I bloat and get moody Take the pill on time
I think this was the worst birth control that I have ever taken I attribute this to the doctor that prescribed it to me She for did not even tell me that she was changing my prescription from ortho tricyclen I went home immediately and looked up reviews for and heard horror stories I gained about 1520 lbs no libido mood swings constantly bigger boobs no complaint there etc There was only one good thing that I could say shorter light periods because mine always lasted a full 7 days and brought a storm with it I finished the whole year because I thought that there was something that I was doing wrong a then I just stopped taking it so I switched
I have been on this Rx for 9 months now and have had pros and cons with this drug I have not had what most women are complaining of such as spotting mood swings or depression In terms of my actual period it was very short and light with little to no cramping I am very satisfied with its effectivness and ease of use However the biggest concern for me is lack in my sex drive The reason I went on this pill was to prevent unwanted pregnancy when having sex not by not wanting sex anymore When I do have sex with my partner I find myself becoming dry very quickly and subsequent pain This was never an issue before I am going to take myself off the pill and see if my sex drive improves and then talk to my doctor about switching to another BC pill
I thought I was going crazy until I started reading reviews I have been taking Junel for a few weeks and have had no motivation for anything but sleep My headaches are terrible Ive never had one in my life Im completely exhausted and dizzy and it always feels like I have a cold I know youre supposed to wait a few months before knowing but I KNOW NOW Dont take Junel its TERRIBLE
I took this pill for a year Starting from the first pack I never had a single period in 12 months and I didnt skip the sugar pills Major complaints ZERO sex drive Lost the ability to orgasm Memory loss Mild acne Dryness Benefits It actually stabilized my mood I used to have HUGE mood swings and panic attacks both of which have totally disappeared I rarely cry now and when I do its only for a good reason It made me gain some weight but not too much around 10 lbs in total but I was anorexic before Also it has obviously prevented me from getting pregnant because I dont even have a menstrual cycle anymore Overall Im switching but only because it makes me feel kind of detached No periods no desire for sex no real emotions whether good or bad I wouldnt say dont try this pill but if you start noticing sexual side effects dont suffer in silence just switch Theres plenty of birth controls out there for you to try
Let me start off by saying that when you are starting or switching birth controls you really do need to allow a few months for your body to adjust I had been taking orthotricyclenlo for about two years when my doctor switched me to junel due to a potential blood clot in one of my legs My first month on junel was horrible I had persistent breakthrough bleeding for 23 weeks constantly felt tired constipated and had abdominal discomfort I was really concerned by these side effects and wanted to switch back but my boyfriend convinced me to wait it out and let my body adjust So I did Aside from the first month with the breakthrough bleeding my experience with junel has been great My periods are only 23 days with few cramps as opposed to before when I had week long periods with severe cramping and breast swelling I also used to have really bad mood swings the week before my period and those seem to have dissipated since I have been on Junel Plus its a lot cheaper than my former birth control I will continue to use Junel and recommend it to women looking for an alternative BC I also strongly urge anyone new to this BC to allow the 13 months for your body to adjust Having been there I know some of the initial side effects are hard to deal with but it will be worth it
This is only my third week on the pill and so far no mood swings actually lost weight Only thing Ive had light bleeding after my period went away From reading these reviews Im very nervous to see what will happen I know everyone is different but Im now seriously considering switching from Junel
This is my first time ever using birth control so I wasnt sure what to expect A friend of mine had recommended this pill to me so I asked my doctor to prescribe it My doctor told me to use it for 3 months so my body can adjust to it and I can really see if I dont like it Ive been on it for 3 weeks now and I have also had mood swings and depression like other reviewers on here For me it wasnt too bad and I had a feeling it was because of the pill so I would just tell myself to get a grip and come back to reality and that usually works for me I have not gained or loss any weight My friend whos been on it for longer than I have told me acne might get worse first but then after 23 months itll totally clear up and my skin will be fine Ive had no hair loss no headaches and no other bad side effects so far other than having some extreme mood swings But Im giving it 3 months like my doctor recommended and Ill give another review after that
I am on day 7 and I am destroying this pack today I am typically a positive bubbly  sunny personality but I am turning into wacko btch on Junel In one weeks time I have swung from feelings of simmering rage to normalcy to numbness and then to depression I even told my husband I wanted to tear out a customers jugular with my teeth today But I knew I needed to stop when I blurted out a wacko and wayoutthere comment this evening during an argument with him This ends now I dont want to go into the loony bin My mental health is way too precious to be taking this garbage
I have had a horrible experience while taking this drug My doctor switched me to this right before my wedding I started feeling detached from my life a few weeks later This feeling has continued to worsen and Ive gone through 2 packs I now cry all the time for no reason and feel trapped almost Ive never suffered from depression and have always been a pretty upbeat positive person My husband thinks its the BC and Im definitely going to stop using it I would not ever recommend it
So I started taking Junel because I was having difficulty getting my period and my doctor told me it would regulate it I have been taking it for a month and I have had severe vaginal bleeding I have been very depressed to the point I dont want to get out of bed on some days My moods changed and everything irritates me and not to mention my sex drive decreased Has anyone encountered these side effects
OkayI know this is sadbut I have been on this medication only for a day and I have had horrible nausea and sensitivity to everything I cant even eat my favorite meal It is pretty much like having morning sickness I feel so horrible and I cant even eat I DO NOT recommend this medication to anyone
I took Junel Fe for three months and have had probably the worst experience of my life Not only did i suffer from severe headaches and stomach aches breast paindepression and loss of sex drive but i developed huge red boils all over my face I have been to countless doctors and they are unsure of my condition however they all agree the pill was most likely the cause I believe it may be a form of cystic acne I have suffered from mild acne in the past but nothing like this I would not recommend this pill to anyone
I have been using Junel FE 120 for 6 months and I havent had any problems no weight gain no hair loss and nooo babies My periods have been very very light except for this month My doctor has recently switched me to microgestin fe 120 and im kind of nervous to take it
I was on Junel for 5 months  my periods would be light spotting for 2 weeks straight It did a great job at preventing pregnancy mainly because I felt like I was always on my period I never had any other side effects But having your period every 2 weeks was bad enough
