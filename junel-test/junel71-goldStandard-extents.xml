<comment>I started taking birth control because I am a runner and have never had a regular period and was told that I would be more susceptible to stress fractures. So I began to take Junel because it was supposed to be a low dosage one. At first I didn't notice really anything besides that if I didn't take it right away in the morning then I would start spotting. Everything just started going downhill from there. I was always emotional and felt like I was on the verge of crying all the time which is so unlike me. For the two months that I was on Junel I gained about 5 pounds which isn't a life changing amount but still a lot for when I'm running 60 or so miles a week. All of my races kept getting worse and worse and finally we came to the conclusion that it might be the birth control. I don't feel nearly as competitive as I used to be and I overall started getting depressed. I was questioning every aspect of my life and had no motivation whatsoever and all I wanted to do was sleep. I'm hoping that in the next few weeks without Junel I will be back to my normal self. I wouldn't recommend this birth control and will definitely do more research before I try birth control again.</comment>
