<comment>Let me start off by saying that when you are starting or switching birth controls you really do need to allow a few months for your body to adjust. I had been taking orthotricyclen-lo for about two years when my doctor switched me to junel due to a potential blood clot in one of my legs. My first month on junel was horrible. I had persistent breakthrough bleeding for 2-3 weeks constantly felt tired constipated and had abdominal discomfort. I was really concerned by these side effects and wanted to switch back but my boyfriend convinced me to wait it out and let my body adjust. So I did. Aside from the first month with the breakthrough bleeding my experience with junel has been great. My periods are only 2-3 days with few cramps as opposed to before when I had week long periods with severe cramping and breast swelling. I also used to have really bad mood swings the week before my period and those seem to have dissipated since I have been on Junel. Plus it's a lot cheaper than my former birth control. I will continue to use Junel and recommend it to women looking for an alternative BC. I also strongly urge anyone new to this BC to allow the 1-3 months for your body to adjust. Having been there I know some of the initial side effects are hard to deal with but it will be worth it.</comment>
