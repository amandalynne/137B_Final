<comment>I really liked using Junel Fe because I have really short and light periods (only last 3 days). The only reason I'm switching is because the hormone dosage is so low that if I take the pill a few hours later than I normally do I have spotting. Other than that a great birth control with almost no side effects (for me).</comment>
