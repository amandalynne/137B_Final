<comment>This has been a horrible experience. I was on the Nuva Ring until I couldn't afford it anymore with no side effects at all. I have been taking Junel for about 2 1/2 months and gained about 10 lbs skin problems and mood swings. I stopped using it yesterday. The worst is that I've been working out 5-6 days a week and dieting and the weight will not come off. Hopefully after stopping I'll see some change.</comment>
