<comment>So far I haven't had any nausea which I usually get from birth control and no hair loss or acne as other people have been complaining about. The only problem is that if I forget to take it at the same time every day I get spotting but I've only been on it for 2 weeks so we'll see how it goes. And my sex drive has actually gone up!</comment>
