<comment>first thing i would like to say is NO PROBLEMS! i dont understand why everyone is upset by this pill maybe i got lucky i dont know? but my attitudes/mood swings/ have stayed normal no increase in anything and yes I GET MY PERIOD EVERY MONTH! never heard of anyone not getting them for that long unless preggo but i always get mine its shorter and lighter but i still get it MAYBE this pill isnt right for everyone but it is great for me! i was on lo estrin 24 before and had lost my insurance and could not afford the 70bucks for it so my doctor gave me junel i love it! its the same as my lo estrin was maybe a little better! but dont let all the reviews scare you away! it depends on your body give a try you may like it you may not if you dont try something else i didnt like a lot of the other pills out there til i got lo estrin and now junel</comment>
