<comment>I was put on this birth control by my doctor when I described my horrible periods. After three months I was happier healthier no weight gain no mood swings and a four day healthy period! I'm so thankful for it. I recently went to visit my obgyn (I'm getting married soon and it will be my first time being sexually active) and she told me that if I was faithful to the pill I would continue to see positive results. I believe many people are not taking the pill when they should. When I miss a day or two I bloat and get moody. Take the pill on time!</comment>
