<comment>Okay...I know this is sad...but I have been on this medication only for a day and I have had horrible nausea and sensitivity to everything! I can't even eat my favorite meal! It is pretty much like having morning sickness! I feel so horrible and I can't even eat. I DO NOT recommend this medication to anyone!</comment>
