<comment>I started taking this medication in February because it was less exoensive then the one I was currently taking. A few months later I missed my period but there didn't seem to be any other side effects. Although after about 6 months of taking it I began experiencing horrible mood swings where I would just start crying without warrant. I also developed heart palpitations acne and (the worst part) hot flashes. I've been on a different bcp for about a week now and almost all of my symptoms have disappeared.</comment>
