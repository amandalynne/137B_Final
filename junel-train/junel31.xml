<comment>Ive been on birth control pills for 7 years now and I am 21. I started taking junel about a year and a half ago and stopped getting my period after 3 months... Haven't had a period in over a year which my gyno said was normal but I think I will switch pills anyway just to be safe. I have lost considerable amount of weight not sure if that is related to the pill or not</comment>
