<comment>I have been on this med for 4 weeks now and being the first time i have ever used birth control for both the uses of Birth control and Acne reasons. The only side affect i have really noticed is the mood swings like everyone else. I am also very happy with its effectivness because I and my boyfriend have had a couple condom breakages since ive been on the pill both being accidental. The pill is easy to take and remeber at 7:30am. It has been very easy on my system and i have not had any feelings of being sick. I am very happy with this med so far we'll see how it goes in the months a head.</comment>
