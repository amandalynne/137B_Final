<comment>On Junel I have the shortest and lightest periods of my life. I used to have extremely heavy periods (like couldn't even sit through an hour long class without both a pad and heavy tampon or I'd have a leak. I have used Yaz in the past and Junel is even more effective. With Junel my periods only last 3-4 days and only one day really requires anything more than a liner to manage the flow.</comment>
