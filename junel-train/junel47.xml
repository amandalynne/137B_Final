<comment>I started taking this med because it was a cheap alternative. I have been on it 8 month and the last three have not had a period. I'm tired all the time. I sleep way too much. I'm easily irratable. And have tons of problems with my contacts and infections in my eyes since I started this pill. I'm not so sure I would reccommend it to anyone. Not getting a period is nice but scary. And mood and sight are also important.</comment>
