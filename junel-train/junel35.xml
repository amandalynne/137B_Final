<comment>I've been on this birth control for almost a year now. Before i even was on the pill my periods were very light and not crampy or painful. I started taking this pill and my period basically dissapeared. It was not a good thing ladies i either would get it a week late or go without a period for 3 months! I took pregnancy tests and everything because i was so concerned. After looking at the reviews i realized that this is a common side effect people on this Birth Control have. Hope this helps anyone going through what i'm going through.</comment>
