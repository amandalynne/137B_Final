<comment>I have been on Junel for about a year now. Pros: I no longer have cramps and i have a lighter and shorter period. I dont get headaches anymore. I havent gained or lost weight either. Cons: ive had a lot of break through bleeding missed period for 2 months in a row moodiness and upset all the time. It works great but my boyfriend is getting tired of my mood swings.</comment>
