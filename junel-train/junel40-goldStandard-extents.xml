<comment>When I first started taking this medication it made me a bit more emotional than usual and I found myself having some mood swings. I also had continual spotting for almost all of the first month on it. However after letting my body adjust I feel perfectly fine. It is easy to take everyday and the periods are light and only last 3-4 days. In the past I used to have extremely bad cramps so this has been a very good lifestyle change.</comment>
