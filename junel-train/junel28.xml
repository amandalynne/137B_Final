<comment>The first two months I experienced sore nipples however during those two months my breasts grew a little over a cup size. Let it be noted though that I also gained five pounds and had an increased appetite. It hasn't affected my sex drive though I've had a little bit more acne for a bit. Junel was the fourth birth control I've tried and I had horrifying mood swings or physical conditions due to the first three. With Junel I'd occasionally feel a little down and there were a good two months when I felt very emotionally numb. However this is the only one I've tried so far that didn't basically physically or emotionally cripple me so I'm somewhat satisfied.</comment>
