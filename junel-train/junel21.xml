<comment>I started taking Birth control for exactly that reason. While I was on Junel FE I turned into a completely different person. I was moody aggressive and depressed. I also gained at least 40 pounds on it. as soon as i stopped taking it I turned back into my self again. I would not recommend this Birth Control to any one.</comment>
