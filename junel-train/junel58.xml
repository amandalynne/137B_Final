<comment>The first few months I would get my period on the days when I was taking the regular pills not the placebos. I attributed it to my body having lower hormone levels than it was used to. When I did get my period it was definitely short but the first day would be extremely heavy. I've now been on Junel for over 18 months and have altogether stopped having a period. Haven't had one in 7 months. I have not noticed any effect on my mood but I do cry at any sign of emotion in the media (movies radio commercials etc.) which did not used to happen. My sex drive has been non-existent since starting this BC it's difficult to lubricate and sex can be painful without additional artificial lubricant. Glad to hear I'm not the only one suffering these symptoms!</comment>
