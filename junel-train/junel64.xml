<comment>I do have to say that in order to properly evaluate a birth control pill you should be on it for 3 months. My first month was terrible. My breasts were SO tender I was moody I didn't feel well in general. After being on Junel for about 5 months I am getting off of it as soon as my new health insurance kicks in in 2 months. The reason being that my breasts still get VERY tender about 2 weeks out of the month but mainly because I have no sex drive whatsoever. Like...NONE. This is so not me and while my boyfriend hasn't complained per se I do feel like it's affecting our relationship. Plus I like having sex. This is just not me. Just a little warning and wondering if anyone else has had my issues.</comment>
