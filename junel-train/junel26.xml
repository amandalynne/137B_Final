<comment>i used this because it was suppose to give me 3 days of period. I'd get three days and then like very low beleeding for two more days. I got PMS almost throughout my cycle and there'd be months where i'd have no sex drive whatsoever. I'm switching now because my mood swings and sex drive on them are horrible</comment>
