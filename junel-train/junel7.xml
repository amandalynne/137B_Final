<comment>I've been on it for 6 to 7 months. I am extremely irritable ad emotional and I also get 2 periods every month one the 2 nd week and one during the sugar pills. It makes me so tired and week and this month is the first time my second period lasted like a day and hasn't come back. I too have to take pregnancy tests just to ease my worry and all that. I get bursts of energy I can usually make it at work but after I too am like a zombie. Mostly I sleep. I'm always extremely tired. I wanna switch but I worry bout whatever they'll put me on next. I might just get the 5 year thing. I just can't take 2 periods every month anymore :(</comment>
