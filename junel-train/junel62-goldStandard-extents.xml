<comment>I have taken this pill for a week now and am in love it with. I use to have the worst mood swings on my old bc or even when I wasn't taking any BC. Being a firefighter the guys at the station knew when it was that time of month and would hate working with me cause I was a complete and total b*tch. I didn't want to do anything and when I did I would be in a really bad mood. I would randomly cry (and I'm NEVER one to cry!) But then next thing you knew I was the happiest person on the planet. Before taking Junel I was a mess! Within the week of getting on this pill I have noticed a boost in energy and am constantly in a good mood. With this boost of energy I have been finding more time to go to the gym and play golf. I don't know how it's going to effect my sex drive like so many other reviews are saying. So far I haven't noticed a difference in sex drive. ;) Overall I do give this pill a good review! It's helped with my moods energy and my period has only lasted a couple days which is the best thing ever! Going from lasting a full 7 days to 3 days!!</comment>
