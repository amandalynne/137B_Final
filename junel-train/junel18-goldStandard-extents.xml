<comment>I had a horrible experience on this birth control. It was the first I had tried and I found that it made me VERY nauseous even when I took it with a meal as I was instructed to do by my doctor. I took it with dinner every night around 7pm and without fail I would wake up at 4:30am every night feeling horribly nauseous. I actually lost quite a bit of weight (that I didn't need or want to lose!) mostly because of my nausea and loss of appetite. Being constantly nauseous also messed up my sex life as I never felt well enough to have sex which my partner (and I!) were less than happy with. I stopped taking this after the first pill of my 3rd cycle when the nausea heightened to the point that I actually vomited. Since stopping the pill I have still been experiencing nausea which I can only assume is related to the pill. I absolutely would NOT recommend this pill to anybody.</comment>
