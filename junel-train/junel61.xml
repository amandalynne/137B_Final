<comment>I cannot believe my doctor would even prescribe this birth control its known for being horrible! I became very sad once i was on this pill and i'm a very happy person too! I had my period for two weeks (while taking the pill not even the sugar pills) also while menstruating i found pieces of uterus tissues coming out along with the blood. This freaked me out and i stopped taking this pill. i wouldn't recommend this to anybody there is a good chance it will mess up your body.</comment>
