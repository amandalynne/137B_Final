<comment>I had none of the bad side effects that I've been reading on here. Perhaps you need at least 3 months for the body to adjust to the new hormones. I lost weight had no acne whatsoever mood was great high energy etc. The only awful side effect I experienced was lack of sex drive. It was so low I hardly ever had sex with my bf which explains how effective junel can be! I am switching to OTC Lo this month!</comment>
