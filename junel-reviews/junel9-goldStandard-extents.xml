<comment>I took this pill for a year. Starting from the first pack I never had a single period in 12 months and I didn't skip the sugar pills. Major complaints: ZERO sex drive. Lost the ability to orgasm. Memory loss. Mild acne. Dryness. Benefits: It actually stabilized my mood I used to have HUGE mood swings and panic attacks both of which have totally disappeared. I rarely cry now and when I do it's only for a good reason. It made me gain some weight but not too much (around 10 lbs in total but I was anorexic before.) Also it has obviously prevented me from getting pregnant because I don't even have a menstrual cycle anymore. Overall: I'm switching but only because it makes me feel kind of... detached. No periods no desire for sex no real emotions whether good or bad. I wouldn't say don't try this pill but if you start noticing sexual side effects don't suffer in silence just switch. There's plenty of birth controls out there for you to try!</comment>
