<comment>When I am on the placebo pills I do not get my period. When I am on the *real* pills I do get my period. I spot most of the month.I am going to get off this. I ahve been on it for 6 months just to be sure to give it a good chance but this spotting is a real problem. I have been wearing a pad for the past 6 months of my life.</comment>
