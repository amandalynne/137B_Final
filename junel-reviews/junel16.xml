<comment>I take the pill to relieve my severe period symptoms. It also seemed like a good decision since I'm sexually active. I haven't had any mood problems outside of my regular clinical depression or any weight gain like some on this site but one thing that was horrible was the breakouts it caused. I've always had clear smooth skin and this stuff had me looking like a pepperoni pizza not even 3 weeks into taking it. I stayed on it since I figured I could change my regimen and fix it but it's only gotten worse and it killed my self esteem. I'm starting Ortho Cyclen tonight so hopefully that will be good for me.</comment>
