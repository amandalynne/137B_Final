<comment>I have had a horrible experience while taking this drug. My doctor switched me to this right before my wedding. I started feeling detached from my life a few weeks later. This feeling has continued to worsen and I've gone through 2 packs. I now cry all the time for no reason and feel trapped almost. I've never suffered from depression and have always been a pretty upbeat positive person. My husband thinks its the BC and I'm definitely going to stop using it. I would not ever recommend it.</comment>
