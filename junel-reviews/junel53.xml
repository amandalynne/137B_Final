<comment>I was taking microgestin fe 1/20 but the pharmacy gave me this one in replacement for two months. Since taking Junel I've had headaches mood swings acne break outs on my chest fatigue and low libido. I didn't have any of these issues on microgestin. I also have been on orth tri cyclen and had no issues. I called the pharmacy to make sure they give me the microgestin from now on. Horrible birth control</comment>
