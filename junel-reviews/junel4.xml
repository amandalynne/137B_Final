<comment>I have only been on this pill for one week and it's been a nightmare. From day one I felt irritable sensitive fatigue anger isolated very moody and no sexual desire. I also started getting severe acne on my face. I am stopping this pill tommorow not a day more with this pill. Don't waste your time this BC is totally not worth it.</comment>
