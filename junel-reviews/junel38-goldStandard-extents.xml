<comment>This was my first BC ever and I gotta tell you I am never getting on any BC EVER again. Doc told me to take it on my first day of period and I have been bleeding for two weeks and counting. Not to mention I am having the worst cramps ever and I'm not even on my period anymore (I think). My bf doesn't like how it makes me sick and told me to get off it. I stopped taking it four days ago but the pain and bleeding is still there. UGH! FORGET THAT! Long Live TROJAN! No more pills for me. This pill needs to be taken off the market like ASAP!</comment>
