<comment>I'm normally a really happy and positive person but since I started taking Junel about a week ago I've been so sad all the time for absolutely no reason. I'll cry or freak out over the littlest things. I have a history of anxiety and depression but it's tolerable for me without being on medication. In the past I had been on Yaz and it made me gain a lot of weight so I stopped taking it. As of recent I had become more sexually active and gotten into a relationship so I figured looking into a new BC would be a good idea. My doctor put me on Junel because it's ridiculously cheap-only 2$ with my insurance and I figured it would be a good start while I looked into IUD which is what I really want. Well after only a week the paranoid feelings of being alone and crying all the time are getting to be way too much for me to handle. I don't feel like myself anymore. My boyfriend says I've been off the past week always upset about everything. I thought maybe it was just my period but I never get bad periods and I get slightly moody with them occasionally but nothing like the way I've been feeling on Junel. After reading everyone's experiences and realizing I'm not crazy or alone in the way this pill has been effecting me I'm going to stop using it for the time being. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone with a history of depression.</comment>
