<comment>I think this was the worst birth control that I have ever taken. I attribute this to the doctor that prescribed it to me. She for did not even tell me that she was changing my prescription (from ortho tricyclen). I went home immediately and looked up reviews for and heard horror stories. I gained about 15-20 lbs. no libido mood swings constantly bigger boobs (no complaint there) etc. There was only one good thing that I could say: shorter light periods because mine always lasted a full 7 days and brought a storm with it. I finished the whole year because I thought that there was something that I was doing wrong a then I just stopped taking it so I switched</comment>
