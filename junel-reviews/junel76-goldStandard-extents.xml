<comment>I started taking this about 5 months ago after having been on Ortho Tricyclen Lo for 4 years. Just two months ago I stopped getting my periods...which I assume is because of my body adjusting to the change in hormone levels after 3 months of being on Junel Fe...a little nervous and not sure why this change has happened. I have not been sexually active recently so that cannot be the problem of a pregnancy. I also have noticed some mood changes too. I might have to switch if I don't get my periods soon it seems so unnatural for that to happen</comment>
