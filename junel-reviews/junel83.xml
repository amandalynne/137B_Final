<comment>WOW. I am so happy I looked up this medication to see if anyone was experiencing the same thing. I also have ZEROOOO desire to have sex. I've been taking Junel for about 5 months now. I linked this to the bc pretty quickly because I've been in a relationship for 3 years and I went from wanted to do it all the time to NEVER. And I knew it wasn't him because now I don't even think about anything remotely sexual at all...about anyone or anything! It just doesn't even enter my mind anymore. Sometimes I try to initiate things because I feel like I should want to but nothing happens. I don't feel turned on or anything. It's so weird! It's like I'm dead. I just go to sleep. Previously I was on LoEstrin for about 5 years and LOVED it. However my new insurance wouldn't cover it. I was told this was comparable. Wrong! I can't wait to get off Junel.</comment>
