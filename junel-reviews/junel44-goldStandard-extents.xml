<comment>I stopped taking birth control for three years because I've had issues with them making me "crazy". I was assured this is a really low dose and should be fine. I have since experienced depression extreme anxiety paranoia lack of sex drive and major mood swings. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.</comment>
