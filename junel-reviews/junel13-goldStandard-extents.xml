<comment>Especially after reading the reviews I wish I had switched off this BC sooner. I've been taking it for a year now and have an appt. tomorrow because I realized my mood swings have gotten out of hand I get upset so easily! My goal and challenge will now be to find a form of BC that works without making me so moody. Any suggestions?</comment>
