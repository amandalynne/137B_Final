<comment>I originally was on Ortho Tri before my doctor randomly switched me to this saying it was basically the same. They are NOT! I've been on Junel for almost 6-7 months now and after reading all these reviews I'm realizing a lot of my symptoms and problems are from this pill. First off I have NO sex drive. At all. I do not desire it. And even during sex when I try for my bf I'm always dry and/or my body does not respond to his touches. Secondly I have put on 40+ lbs and I've always been a slim girl. And even with high intense cardio kickboxing classes I still havent gotten the weight off. Also my periods are more painful and involve extreme bloating and sever constipation. I've never had that before on my old BC. Also occasionally while in the middle of the week with the white pills I'll feel like I'm randomly having cramps and it hurts. I would not suggest this pill to anyone.</comment>
