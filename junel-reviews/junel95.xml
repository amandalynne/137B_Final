<comment>So I started taking Junel because I was having difficulty getting my period and my doctor told me it would regulate it. I have been taking it for a month and I have had severe vaginal bleeding I have been very depressed to the point I don't want to get out of bed on some days My moods changed and everything irritates me and not to mention my sex drive decreased... Has anyone encountered these side effects.</comment>
