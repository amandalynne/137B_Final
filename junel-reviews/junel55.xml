<comment>Made me get recurring yeast infections. I never had any vaginal problems until taking this medication. I just finished my last pack. I had very painful breasts and was very moody and emotional. It also made me hungry 24/7. Worked great for preventing pregnancy but the side effects are not worth it so I'm done.</comment>
