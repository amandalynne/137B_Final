<comment>i've been on this for several months now and have had no problems with it thus far. The only thing that tends to happen is that i will randomly lightly bleed when i am not taking the iron pills. I don't have bad mood swings my hair does not fall out i have not gained or loss any weight. nothing.</comment>
