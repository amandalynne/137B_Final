<comment>I am on day 7 and I am destroying this pack today. I am typically a positive bubbly & sunny personality but I am turning into wacko b*tch on Junel. In one week's time I have swung from feelings of simmering rage to normalcy to numbness and then to depression. I even told my husband I wanted to tear out a customer's jugular with my teeth today! But I knew I needed to stop when I blurted out a wacko and way-out-there comment this evening during an argument with him. This ends now. I don't want to go into the loony bin. My mental health is way too precious to be taking this garbage.</comment>
