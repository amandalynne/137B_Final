<comment>I have been on this med for about 4 months. I mainly got on Junel due to the fact that I wanted to gain weight which it indeed help me with. However the breakthrough bleeding in-between periods sucks. And then when is my period coming??? who knows...it kind of freaks a 21 y.o. female out. Pregnancy is not a thing any person wants to guess on. A period tells us women that our uterine lining in "sloughing" off and that their is no implanted fetus in there.</comment>
