<comment>I am almost done with my 1 month packet and I am switching BCs. I cannot take it anymore! I am dizzy sore nauseous overly-sensitive unfocused & tired all the time. It has made me very emotional and bipolar. One minute I am crying excessively over stupid things and the next thing you know I hate everyone. Yesterday I was looking for a laptop online and this customer service lady popped up and I got so angry at her for showing up! Also I have started swearing constantly but I can't stop it! Do not take this...unless you want to be pissed off at the world and cry at the same time.</comment>
