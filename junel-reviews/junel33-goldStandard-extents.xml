<comment>Starting taking Loestrin Fe for excessive PMS issues. The Loestrin Fe became more and more expensive so I asked the dr to change to an inexpensive generic -- Junel Fe. First months was okay; second month ended with yeast infection; third month I am constantly feeling sick light headed painful stomach cramps bloating constipation and urgent feeling to go to the bathroom (but then nothing happens)â€¦. these symptoms are really too much. After reading the other reviews I am stopping this pill today as it seems like there is not a end to my symptoms and even more are yet to come (acne hair loss depression).</comment>
