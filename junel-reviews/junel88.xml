<comment>I have been on this Rx for 9 months now and have had pros and cons with this drug. I have not had what most women are complaining of such as spotting mood swings or depression. In terms of my actual period it was very short and light with little to no cramping. I am very satisfied with it's effectivness and ease of use. However the biggest concern for me is lack in my sex drive. The reason I went on this pill was to prevent unwanted pregnancy when having sex not by not wanting sex anymore. When I do have sex with my partner I find myself becoming dry very quickly and subsequent pain. This was never an issue before. I am going to take myself off the pill and see if my sex drive improves and then talk to my doctor about switching to another BC pill.</comment>
