<comment>I have been taking Junel for about nine months and my one complaint is a major one: i don't get periods. before being on BC i had always had short light periods but now they either last a day and are very light or don't happen at all for months at a time. i've gotten myself so worked up about worrying about being pregnant to the point where i have to take a home pregnancy test every once in a while for peace of mind. this is reason enough to stay away from this pill. however everyone is different. aside from this one horrible effect i don't have any other complaints about Junel. No weight gain mood changes fatigue or changes in skin.</comment>
