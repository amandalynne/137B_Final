<comment>I took Junel Fe for three months and have had probably the worst experience of my life. Not only did i suffer from severe headaches and stomach aches breast paindepression and loss of sex drive but i developed huge red boils all over my face. I have been to countless doctors and they are unsure of my condition however they all agree the pill was most likely the cause. I believe it may be a form of cystic acne. I have suffered from mild acne in the past but nothing like this. I would not recommend this pill to anyone.</comment>
