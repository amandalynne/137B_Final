<comment>I just took this pill forteh first time at 8:30 last night this morning at 8:30 i began to get really overheated and a little dizzy i thought i might throw up but i didn't about 30 seconds later i'm walking out of the bathroom into the hall of my dorm and i got tunnel vision everything was going black till i couldn't see anymore i was running into walls trying to get to my room i made it to my bed and layed down. This probably took place over the course of just a few minutes but it was terrifying. I called my doctor and she told me to stop taking Junel.</comment>
