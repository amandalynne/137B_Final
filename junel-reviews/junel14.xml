<comment>I started taking it on the first day of my period. Had no side affects until the 2nd day. Started getting nausous and throwing up. My period is heavier than usual.. the cramps which usually go away after the second day lasted my entire period and were much worse than usual. It also made me moody.. have night sweats.. irregular heart beat and throw up. Not something I would recommend.</comment>
