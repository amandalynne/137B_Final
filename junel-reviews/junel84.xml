<comment>I ignored all of the negative reviews for this and it was a huge mistake. I recently went on Junel for the first time. I took Levora for 8 years and had no issues with it aside from a 3-5 pound weight gain but after being off of it for a few months I decided to try another one that would potentially not cause me to gain weight. I should have taken the weight gain. This medication made me feel like I was losing my mind. I broke out terribly was extremely irritable and had EXTREME anxiety and depression. Junel basically turned me into a zombie. I already suffer from anxiety so maybe this isn't a good choice for people who have anxiety to begin with. Go with Levora.</comment>
