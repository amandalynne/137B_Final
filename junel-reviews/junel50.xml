<comment>I was put on Junel for ovarian cysts and pain during my period and since starting Junel I haven't had any problems with my ovaries and the pain has gone down a lot. I've been on Junel for over a year and haven't had any problems with it. I haven't had any painful cysts re-occur or irregularity with periods. I haven't had any problems with weight gain or acne either.</comment>
