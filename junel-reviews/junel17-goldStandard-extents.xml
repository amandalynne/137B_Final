<comment>I have been on probably every form of birth control imaginable.. so I think my assessment of these drugs might be accurate to those with my condition. The first form of BC I was on was Loestrine to which I lost a ton of weight but wanted to murder everyone that even looked at me. Yaz did the same. My weight remained consistent but the same time every month I thought my life was coming to an end and there was no point of me even living any more. Through several other attempts to regulate both my period and my mood my doctor decided Junel Fe would be the best fit for me. Boy was she wrong. I'm still just as depressed I'm fatigued all the time not to mention since being on it (for 4 months now) I have gained about 20 lbs!!! I work out every day and eat healthier than most. I'm starting Zovia next month and let's keep our fingers crossed that this will help me get rid of my Junel Fat!</comment>
