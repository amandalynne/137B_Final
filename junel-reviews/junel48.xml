<comment>I started taking this drug about 2 weeks ago and boy not only did my hair start falling out but my sex drive plumeted as well I have had the MOST horriable mood swings I will just sit and cry for no reason at all. I have stopped taking this drug. I would not recommend it for anyone.</comment>
